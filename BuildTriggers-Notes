There are several Build triggers in Jenkins.

- Build whenver a SNAPSHOT dependency is built 
    - This is more like a manual build
- Build after other projects are build
       - option like building one after the other build
-  Build Periodically 
       - based on the cron job irrespective of the git commit changes
       
- GitHub hook triggers for GITScm polling

- "POLL SCM"
 "Poll SCM" polls the SCM periodically for checking if any changes/ new commits were made and shall build the project
 if any new commits were pushed since the last build.
