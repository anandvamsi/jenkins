#maven installation
docker exec -it -u root 295b714294c3 /bin/bash :- login to docker as the root user
apt-get update
apt-get install maven



Pipelines jobs vs freeStyle jobs 
--------------
Helps to combines all the free style jobs into single into a single defination as a code
Another different is , pipeline jobs resumes back even if the jenkins got killed whereas freestyle job won't 
Free style jobs dont have clue what was running before/prior 
Durable::- Pipeliness can survicve both planned and unplanned restarts of your jenkins controller
Pausable::- Pipelines can optionally pause stop/wait for human output
Extensible::- Pipelines plugins suports custom extentions to its DSL
