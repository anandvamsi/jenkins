How to install Maven


Maven? what is need maven
-------
Maven is a build tool, under the Apache Licence.
Maven also helps in creating reports, documentation,Packaging 

Maven solves deps(jar files), thirdparty libs of the java project.
- mysql jars, selemium jars

what Maven solves:

problem 1:
without Maven we need to download all the jars from different websites and attach to the project
which is a manual tasks

problem2:-
if we want to upgrade the jars/lib we need to remove all the existing jars and download the latest
jars from different websites

Solution
------------
Above problems are solved by integrating maven as the part of the project which will downlod
deps/libs





pom.xml::- Two important sections of Pom.xml is the mention the deps and Package name
- deps
- plugins

- need to mention the dependencies
  - Group id:- com.anand
  - Artifactid :- demo
  - Package:- com.anand.demo.web
  
  whenever we work with maven, we need to make sure we do have internet do downloads the deps, for the first time all the deps are downloaded from internet
  and caches in the local reposiotry 
  But change in version/Upgration of the jar
